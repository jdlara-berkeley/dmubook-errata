Errata to Decision Making Under Uncertainty: Theory and Application

* Alg. 4.12 (line 4): replace ; with | to be consistent with the notation used in this section (Jon Cox)
* Eq. 6.11: switch a and s in the transition function to be consistent with the notation in the book (Max Egorov)
* Eq. 2.61: (v_i - \hat\mu) should be squared
* P. 59, sentence before eq. 3.3: replace u^1 with c^1 (David Wagner)
* Eq. 2.76: equals sign to should be \propto (Haruki Nishimura)
* Sec. 3.1.1: in independence condition, second \succ should be \succeq (Ellen Blaine)
* Fig. 6.6: some of the alpha vectors did not print correctly (noted by Yi-Chun Chen); the figure should look like this: <img src="alphavectors.png" alt="fig.6.6" width="300">
* Sec. 6.4.5 (second sentence): replace "each belief state B" with "each belief state in B" (Zongzhang Zhang)
* Sec. 4.2.4 (last sentence): replace "2*epsilon*gamma/(1-gamma)" with "2*epsilon" (Zongzhang Zhang)
